  bio: "Interests: Pre- and perinatal influences in neurodevelopment and in risk for major mental disorders, such as schizophrenia and depression; gene-environment interactions; risk factors in adolescence for schizophrenia (e.g. the prodrome of schizophrenia); multimodal imaging; neuropsychological assessments; psychoneuroimmunology; stress; psychiatric epidemiology. Lauren M. Ellman, Ph.D. is an Associate Professor in the Clinical area of the Psychology department at Temple University. Generally, Dr. Ellman’s research focuses on two sensitive periods of development in the prediction of schizophrenia and related disorders, the prenatal period and adolescence. This research is aimed at determining risk factors for schizophrenia in order to ultimately identify those who are vulnerable to developing the disorder and intervene at early stages to prevent the onset of serious psychiatric symptoms. Dr. Ellman has multiple ongoing studies examining pre- and perinatal contributions to schizophrenia using birth cohorts in the United States and Finland, with access to biosamples from pre- and perinatal periods. Using these cohorts, Dr. Ellman has focused on a variety of obstetric insults, such as psychosocial and neuroendocrine indicators of stress, maternal infection and maternal immune responses to infection during pregnancy, and biological indicators of hypoxia (decreased oxygen to the fetus). In these studies, Dr. Ellman explores how obstetric risk factors influence the neurodevelopmental course of schizophrenia, including premorbid functioning (e.g. motor, cognitive, and social) and functional outcomes after the onset of the disorder (e.g. neuropsychological, brain abnormalities, and symptom severity). Lastly, Dr. Ellman has a continued interest in how obstetric factors are influenced by genetic vulnerabilities related to schizophrenia. Dr. Ellman also has ongoing studies investigating risk factors for schizophrenia among older adolescents and young adults using clinical, psychosocial, and neuroimaging techniques. These studies are designed to identify individuals at risk for schizophrenia prior to the onset of the disorder. In all of Dr. Ellman’s studies, she takes a life-span approach to psychopathology, investigating how risk factors influence the course of the disorder at different developmental stages and interact with existing vulnerabilities within the individual, such as genetic susceptibility to mental disorders. Dr. Ellman received her B.A. in philosophy and psychology from Tulane University. She received her Ph.D. in clinical psychology from the University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) with a health psychology minor. As a doctoral student, Dr. Ellman received training in psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) through UCLA’s Cousin’s center in PNI and she was a NIMH-funded predoctoral fellow through the health psychology program at UCLA. She completed her APA-accredited internship at the Sepulveda VA Ambulatory Care Center in Los Angeles, California. Dr. Ellman also completed a NIMH-funded National Research Service Award (NRSA) postdoctoral fellowship at Columbia University in the schizophrenia research fellowship program. In addition, Dr. Ellman has garnered numerous pre- and postdoctoral awards and has reviewed for multiple prestigious journals, including JAMA Psychiatry (formerly Archives of General Psychiatry), Behavior, Brain, and Immunity, Schizophrenia Bulletin, Biological Psychia try, Psychoneuroendocrinology and others. Dr. Ellman also has been trained in multiple forms of therapy and has supervised students in various theoretical modalities. She has extensive experiences working with a diverse array of client populations, with a special focus on working with individuals who are suffering from schizophrenia, as well as individuals exhibiting the first signs of psychosis. Dr. Ellman also has training in neuropsychological assessments, both clinically and in her various research projects. Dr. Ellman is a member of the Psychoneuroimmunology Research Society and the American Psychological Association."

  bio: "I have a broad background in neuropsychology, with specific training and expertise in the breakdown of everyday functioning in older adults with neurodegenerative cognitive disorders, including vascular cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease. While conducting studies on the executive and episodic memory deficits associated with cerebrovascular disease in graduate school, I developed a strong interest in the everyday, functional consequences of these deficits. As an NRSA postdoctoral fellow, I completed studies that characterized the breakdown of everyday functioning in older adults with various cognitive disorders. I also developed methods for reliably evaluating performance on complex daily activities, including novel paradigms and coding schemes for error types and error monitoring. Upon joining the faculty at Temple University in 2003, I established a laboratory focused on understanding everyday functional deficits using these novel methods. I also formed new collaborations at Temple, including a productive relationship with Dr. Deborah Drabick that has expanded my repertoire of statistical methods. The research that I have completed at Temple has shown that individuals with dementia differ meaningfully in the type of difficulties that they experience with everyday tasks, with some individuals omitting large task segments and others completing task steps inaccurately. These distinct functional profiles are associated with different cognitive deficits and neuroimaging profiles. These findings and others have led to the development of a novel neuropsychological model for everyday, functional deficits in dementia. Our current research goals are to examine the utility of this model for 1) understanding the more subtle functional deficits reported in people with Mild Cognitive Impairment, 2) identifying older adults most at risk for pathological cognitive decline, and 3) informing interventions to improve functional outcomes. Through my collaborations with Drs. David Libon, Cate Price, and Thomas Floyd, I also continue to explore the cognitive effects of cerebrovascular disease in older adults through studies of cognitive aging, dementia, HIV, and cardiac surgery."

  bio: "I have been teaching at Temple University for 44 years. I am happy to say that every now and then a student informs me that my lecture was awesome. Surprise is essential for learning and memory formation. Many students tell me that my courses are demanding and that they learn a lot from me. That is how I believe it should be in any institution of higher learning."
