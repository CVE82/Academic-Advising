## New Student FAQ
Is your first semester at college fast approaching? If so, this is one of the most exciting times of your life! But it might also mean you’ve got a lot of questions. Don’t worry—that’s normal. At Temple University’s College of Liberal Arts, you’ll be able to [choose your academic advisor](#who-will-be-my-academic-advisor), get [your questions answered](#i-have-so-many-questions), get continued help throughout your academic career and have someone to turn to even when you have [questions that go beyond academics](#what-if-i-have-an-issue-beyond-academics). 

Once you complete new student orientation, please drop us a line at 215-204-7971 or [claaac@temple.edu](mailto:claaac@temple.edu) to get started.

## Who Will Be My Academic Advisor?
Your personal academic path won’t be exactly the same as anyone else’s. That’s because it’ll be tailored to what you want to get out of college and how you want your education to empower you in your life and career ahead. To do that most effectively, we pair you with the advisor who makes the most sense for you. How do we know your advisor is best for you? Easy. We let you pick him or her!
The College of Liberal Arts has a diverse team of advisors. Some of them grew up here in Philadelphia, while others are from around the country and even overseas, and they have varied backgrounds and educational experiences. That means you’re sure to find the friendly face of someone you can relate to.

As a new student, you’ll be able to [choose the advisor](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/content/academic-advising) who’s the best fit for you.

## I Have So Many Questions!
What courses should you be taking? How do you register for those courses? What sort of academic goals should you set for yourself? Where are the important resources around campus? What are my options for studying abroad? Most of all, just what exactly is being a student on Temple’s Main Campus going to be like? 

If these sort of questions are on your mind, know that you’ll get an advisor to give you the answers you’re looking for. The move from high school to college is a big one, and we want to make sure you enjoy the experience while getting the most out of it academically. The College of Liberal Arts has an incredibly diverse curriculum of courses for you to choose from, many avenues for supporting your academic progress and a variety of choices for how, where and when you learn. All you have to do is contact your advisor.

## How Can My Advisor Help Me After I Register and Settle into College?
One of the first things you’ll need to do once you enroll at the College of Liberal Arts is register for courses, and you’ll of course have to do so every semester. Your advisor will guide you through registration, but he or she will also be here to help you with so much more.

Some students know exactly what they want to major in. Others don’t. Either way, they always have an advisor to help them stay on track and find their way. That’s because picking a major isn’t something everyone does once and never changes. Around half of Temple students change their major at least once. So whether you’re undeclared, have second thoughts about your major or want to add a minor or another major, your advisor will help you pair your interests with an academic plan that fits them. And if and when the time comes to change that plan, they’ll help you make the best choice to study what excites you most.

## What If I Have an Issue Beyond Academics?
It’s a clichéd saying that success isn’t a straight path, but that doesn’t make it untrue. No one goes through life or school unchallenged. When you encounter a problem, we want to be there to get you through it. If you run into some trouble as a student with your academics, financials, campus life or anything related to college, you’ll always have someone to turn to for help in your advisor. He or she will either have a solution ready for you or will get you to the person who does.
