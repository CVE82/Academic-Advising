The Center for Academic Advising and Professional Development counsels students on issues relating to both classroom and career. We can help you navigate your curriculum, choose a major, explore career opportunities and determine your post-graduation plans.

## Make an Appointment
If you would like to meet with an advisor, call [215-204-7971](tel:2152047971) to make an appointment.

Same day academic appointments are available on a first-come, first-served basis on the main campus. At the beginning of the semester—during priority registration and new student orientations—many students utilize our services, so it pays to plan ahead. During non-peak times, you may schedule an appointment as much as five business days in advance.

We also offer academic advising at the Ambler and Center City (TUCC) campuses. Please call [267-468-8200](tel:2674688200) to schedule an appointment at Ambler. If you wish to be advised at TUCC, please email [Paula Robison](mailto:Paula.Robison@temple.edu).

## Be Prepared
Before your academic advising appointment, please check your DARS to review completed and unfulfilled requirements:

- Go to: [dars.temple.edu](http://dars.temple.edu/)
- Log in, using your TU username and password
- Click “Run Audit”
- A history of previous DARS Audits will appear, select the most recent one (the one on top) by clicking “View Audit”
- Your current DARS Audit will appear
