Pre-law students in the College of Liberal Arts may select any of our 35 majors as their plan of study, and many opt to enhance their undergraduate career with a second major or a minor. This flexibility to build an impressive and eclectic undergraduate résumé in the humanities, social
sciences — and beyond — can make all the difference in the law school application process.

Law Schools do not favor any particular major, but rather, look for students with a breadth of learning and excellent academic skills — especially critical thinking, analytical reading comprehension, and argumentative writing. All departments and programs in the College of Liberal Arts excel in teaching these skills, which are integral to performing optimally on the LSAT exam — the most crucial factor in law school admissions.
