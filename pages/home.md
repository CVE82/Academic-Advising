## What do Pre-Law Students Major In?
Law Schools do not favor any particular major, but rather, look for students with critical thinking, analytical reading comprehension and argumentative writing skills. All departments and programs in the College of Liberal Arts excel in teaching these skills, which are integral to getting a good score on the LSAT exam — the most crucial factor in law school admissions. You can select any of our 35 majors and enhance it with a second major or minor. The flexibility to build an impressive and eclectic undergraduate résumé in the humanities and social sciences is a huge bonus when it comes to applying to law school.
