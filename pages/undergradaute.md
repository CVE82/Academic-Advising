## Preparing for Law School
Successful law students come from all walks of life and undergraduate backgrounds. Just like Temple’s College of Liberal Arts, law schools value the different perspectives that students bring to the classroom. The American Bar Association (ABA) does not recommend specific undergraduate majors or types of classes, but encourages you to develop sharp research, critical thinking and writing skills. Choose a major you are passionate about, whether it is English or political science, and take courses that challenge you.

## Financial Aid and Scholarships
If you need help paying for college, you aren’t alone. Most college students receive some form of financial aid to fund their education. The FAFSA, or Free Application for Federal Student Aid, is the primary form that the government, states and Temple University uses to award grants, scholarships, work study and student loans. Filling out the FAFSA often results in a substantial boost in financial assistance. Learn more about getting financial aid at the Student Financial Services.
