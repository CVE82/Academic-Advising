## Program Overview

The Department of Psychology has a strong commitment to scholarly and scientific excellence. It has been heralded as one of the most diverse universities in the nation. This setting offers exciting opportunities for research and scholarly discourse.

The Temple University Undergraduate Psychology program provides a modern curriculum covering a breadth of content, ranging from biological bases of cognition and behavior to sociocultural influences on human interactions and psychological disorders. The curriculum is designed to develop students’ critical thinking skills through emphasis of the scientific basis of Psychology and courses in statistics and research methodology. The program also emphasizes the integration and synthesis of information across courses and activities through the stepwise progression of the curriculum from the introductory, foundational, and advanced classes up to the final capstone course that is taken in the senior year.

Students are strongly encouraged to develop applied skills through rigorous and highly focused experiential learning in research laboratories and community–based internships. The curriculum is designed to be sufficiently flexible to satisfy the diversity of needs among undergraduates. As such an individually tailored curriculum may be selected for the purpose of preparing students for employment or further study in psychology, neuroscience, medicine, law, business, or other fields.

## Program Description

The 4+1 Master in Psychological Research offers outstanding Temple University psychology majors the opportunity to earn both the Bachelor of Arts in Psychology and the Master of Science in Psychological Research in just 5 years. Admission to the program is highly selective.  The program is designed to provide a research-intensive experience, advanced coursework, and professional development to students who intend to pursue doctoral studies in any of the academic psychology disciplines.

Students admitted to the program will complete 30 credits during the senior year, of which 9 credits are graduate courses. These 9 credits will count toward both the BA and MS degrees.  Each student will work with a faculty sponsor to develop and implement a master’s project.
On completion of the senior year, students receive the BA in Psychology, then are formally admitted to the MS program in Psychological Research (with 9 graduate credits already completed).
During the fifth year, 4+1 students will complete 23 graduate credits, including courses in research methods, statistics, ethics, topical seminars, a professional development seminar series, and master’s project research.
