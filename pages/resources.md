## Student Run Activities 

The College offers a range of student-run activities that will be of interest to pre-law students, including:

## Temple University Mock Trial Team

The College of Liberal Arts has supported a successful [mock trial team](https://temple.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/tumocktrial) for many years. Every year, two teams from Temple enter the national American Mock Trial Association Competition and compete against teams from the region. Temple teams have regularly competed against (and defeated) teams from Yale Princeton, NYU, University of Maryland, and Villanova, among others. The team’s two coaches are both practicing lawyers and alums of Temple University’s Beasley School of Law’s nationally ranked Trial Advocacy Program.

## Temple University Debate Team

The [Temple Debate Society](https://temple.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/templedebate) competes on the most popular circuit in the United States, the American Parliamentary Debate Association, (APDA) but we encourage all types of public discourse, both competitive and non-competitive. The purpose of this organization is to develop speech and debating skills both among its members and the local community. The team provides access for its members to compete and/ or participate in debate, speech, and forensics tournaments, including those held on a national and international level.

## Temple University Black Law Students Association

The [Black Law Student Association (Pre-Law Division)](https://www.law.temple.edu/academics/intellectual-life/student-organizations/) is a student organization dedicated to making pre-law students more competitive law school applicants. The organization confronts the high racial disparity in the legal field by preparing pre-law students to attend law school.

## Pre-Law Society

[Pre-Law Society](https://temple.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/prelaw_society) meets regularly throughout the semester and is open to all majors. Apart from social events, the society hosts speakers such as law school admissions officers, LSAT prep organizations, and CLA alumni lawyers and law students. The Society also organizes visits to law schools and law school fairs in the area, as well as LSAT practice exams and study-groups. Pre-law Society is a great way to meet other pre-law students in the College.
