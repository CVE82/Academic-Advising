**B.A. The College of Wooster, Political Science**<br>
**M.A. Adelphi University, Psychology**<br>

Hailing from the same sleepy little town as Pulitzer Prize-winning author Conrad Richter, Chris spent the better part of his 20’s in an ‘89 Corolla, exploring 49 of the 50 states (Alaska and New Mexico are his favorites) before running out of gas in Des Moines, Iowa and remaining in town for a ten-month dose of Midwestern hospitality.  After brief stints living in California, Maryland and New York, Chris finally settled in Philadelphia, where he lives in the East Falls neighborhood with his wife Catie, a Ph.D. candidate in Temple’s Urban Education program.  He has enjoyed a variety of roles at Temple since joining the university in 2003, and in February, 2009, reunited with his first love, the CLA advising center, to serve as director.  Chris also serves as membership chair for Temple’s chapter of Phi Beta Kappa and is a proud member of the National Academic Advising Association.

**B.A. Temple University, Psychology**<br>
**M.Ed. Temple University, Educational Administration**<br>

Anar was born in the bustling city of Mumbai, India, but she has spent most of her life in the outskirts of Philadelphia.  She had a love for Temple engrained in her at an early age, as several of her family members (including her mother and sister) are Temple alums.  As an undergraduate student at Temple, Anar worked as a peer advisor in the Division of University Studies and realized then that higher education was her true calling.  Anar has found it quite impossible to leave Temple, earning her Master’s degree here while continuing to serve in a variety of advising roles.  It could truly be said that she bleeds cherry and white.  She is very happy to have a home at Temple, and she hopes to remain with the Temple family for years to come.

**B.A. University of Georgia, Art History**<br>
**M.A. New York University, Arts Administration**<br>

Originally from Mt. Sterling, Kentucky, Keesa comes to Philadelphia by way of Ohio, Georgia, New York, and California. In addition to travelling to multiple destinations in the US, including one cross-country adventure spanning eleven states, she developed a taste for life abroad when she got the opportunity to study art history and the humanities during an all-too-brief semester at Oxford University. While working toward her Master’s degree in Arts Administration at New York University, Keesa served as a Graduate Assistant for the M.F.A. Studio program. She credits this experience as a defining moment in her career.   As she quickly realized, she preferred the company of students to the inanimate art objects she would be expected to handle in an art museum.  Previously an Admissions Counselor in New York and an Internship Coordinator in Philadelphia, Keesa comes to Temple with an enthusiasm for helping students meet their academic and professional goals.  Her interests include gallery hopping, live performances, tech related stuff and gadgets, playing fetch with Oscar the dog, and attempting to keep up with friends on both coasts.
