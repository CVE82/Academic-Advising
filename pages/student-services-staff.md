**[Chris Wolfgang, Director](mailto:cwolfgan@temple.edu)**<br>
**B.A. The College of Wooster, Political Science**<br>
**M.A. Adelphi University, Psychology**<br>

Hailing from the same sleepy little town as Pulitzer Prize-winning author Conrad Richter, Chris spent the better part of his 20’s in an ‘89 Corolla, exploring 49 of the 50 states (Alaska and New Mexico are his favorites) before running out of gas in Des Moines, Iowa and remaining in town for a ten-month dose of Midwestern hospitality.  After brief stints living in California, Maryland and New York, Chris finally settled in Philadelphia, where he lives in the East Falls neighborhood with his wife Catie, a Ph.D. candidate in Temple’s Urban Education program.  He has enjoyed a variety of roles at Temple since joining the university in 2003, and in February, 2009, reunited with his first love, the CLA advising center, to serve as director.  Chris also serves as membership chair for Temple’s chapter of Phi Beta Kappa and is a proud member of the National Academic Advising Association.

**Favorite Books:** _A Confederacy of Dunces_ by John Kennedy Toole, _High Fidelity_ by Nick Hornby, _Independence Day_ by Richard Ford, _The Tipping Point_ by Malcolm Gladwell,_Moneyball_by Michael Lewis and _Holidays on Ice_ by David Sedaris.
